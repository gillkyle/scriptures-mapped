## Scriptures Mapped

A simple web app using vanilla technologies to display a map of locations from the scriptures.

I learned that debugging from Chrome can be a fast way to see what data your variables hold at runtime. Rather than just `console.log`-ing everything, setting breakpoints in the browser is a superior way to find out what's going on.

I learned several interesting practices and really enjoyed taking an approach that was very "vanilla" Javascript. I liked the idea of encapsulating methods inside of Scriptures and liked seeing how the whole project was architected without having to worry myself about questions like "am I building this the right way?"

I felt like at points where I was writing nested HTML content in javascript returns smelled a little at first, and then it generally got refactored away. In the end I found the whole initial phase really interesting.

While working on design changes and updates to the overall UX I ran into several issues and had to refactor in a number of places. I wish that I had had a better idea up front of what I wanted the whole design to look like, had I maybe sketched out what I thought would work better may have helped me to implement more updates at a time without having to refactor in as many places.

I made some small tweaks like changing where the next and previous buttons were located since I figured a reader would likely read to an end of a chapter and then see the button right where they finished, prompting them to go to the next or previous chapter without having to walk their gaze back up.

A lot of colors were changed to softer blues, and the layout was set to list the scriptures on top on small viewports with the map at the bottom.
