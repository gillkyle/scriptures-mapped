## Scriptures Mapped

A simple web app using vanilla technologies to display a map of locations from the scriptures.

### Log

I learned that debugging from Chrome can be a fast way to see what data your variables hold at runtime. Rather than just `console.log`-ing everything, setting breakpoints in the browser is a superior way to find out what's going on.

I learned several interesting practices and really enjoyed taking an approach that was very "vanilla" Javascript. I liked the idea of encapsulating methods inside of Scriptures and liked seeing how the whole project was architected without having to worry myself about questions like "am I building this the right way?"

I felt like at points where I was writing nested HTML content in javascript returns smelled a little at first, and then it generally got refactored away. In the end I found the whole initial phase really interesting.
